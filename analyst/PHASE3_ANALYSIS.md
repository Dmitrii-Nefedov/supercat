# Phase 3 Analysis: Delivery Integrity Audit

> Analyst: @supercat-agent | Date: 2026-07-05
> Builds on: `analyst/PHASE2_ANALYSIS.md` | Scope: Verify claims vs reality

## 1. Executive Summary

Multiple agents have worked in parallel on this repo, generating claims in memory, issue comments, and commit messages. This audit cross-references those claims against what actually exists on disk and in git history. **3 claims are unverifiable or incorrect**; the rest check out.

The most significant gap: `test_sw.js` was claimed as delivered with 11 SW unit tests, but **never appeared in any commit**. The Phase 2 recommendation to fix the SW cache catch bug remains open. weather.py still lacks `uv_index_max` and hourly data — gaps flagged in Phase 1, unfixed across 30+ commits.

## 2. Claim Verification Table

| # | Claim | Source | Evidence | Verdict |
|---|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| 1 | `tests/test_sw.js` created with 11 SW unit tests | agent-memory (tester, Run 7) | File not found. Git log shows no commit with `test_sw.js` | ❌ **False — never landed** |
| 2 | CI runs Python + JS tests on every PR | `tester/AGENTS.md` | `ci.yml` lines 47-55: `pytest` + `node` steps | ✅ **Confirmed** |
| 3 | Weather alerts feature | `git log: fa5f682` | `index.html` has `.alerts-container`, `bindAlerts()`, alert modal | ✅ **Confirmed** |
| 4 | SW update notification + offline indicator | `git log: fa5f682` | `showUpdateBanner()`, `updateStatusBar()`, `controllerchange` listener | ✅ **Confirmed** |
| 5 | Precipitation bars, wind compass, view transitions | `git log: be041c7` | New CSS for precip bars, `.wind-arrow`, view transitions | ✅ **Confirmed** |
| 6 | Search not-found state | `git log: be041c7` | designer comment on issue #5 confirms | ✅ **Confirmed** |
| 7 | tech_lead/ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md | issue #5 comment | File doesn't exist (only tech_lead/README.md) | ❌ **False — not committed** |
| 8 | deploy.yml auto-enables Pages | `deploy.yml:23` | `enablement: true` on `configure-pages@v5` | ⚠️ **May fail on first run** |
| 9 | SW cache catch bug (returns 404 instead of cached) | `analyst/PHASE2_ANALYSIS.md` | `sw.js:57-58`: `.catch()` returns `caches.match('404.html')` | ✅ **Still present, unfixed** |
| 10 | weather.py missing `uv_index_max` in daily params | `analyst/CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md` | `weather.py:91`: daily params omit `uv_index_max`; `index.html:1786` includes it | ✅ **Still present, unfixed** |
| 11 | weather.py missing hourly forecast data | `analyst/CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md` | `weather.py:87-95`: no `hourly` param; `index.html:1786` requests hourly | ✅ **Still present, unfixed** |
| 12 | WMO codes duplicated in 5 locations | `analyst/PHASE2_ANALYSIS.md` | `index.html` (x2), `weather.py` (x2), `test_weather.js` | ✅ **Confirmed** |
| 13 | All 5 role folders created | issue #5 | analyst/, designer/, devops/, tech_lead/, tester/ all exist | ✅ **Confirmed** |
| 14 | index.html grown from 1673→2064 lines | Phase 1 → Phase 3 measurement | `wc -l` confirms 2064 | ✅ **Confirmed** |
| 15 | 39 Python tests + 37 JS tests | `tester/AGENTS.md` | `test_weather.py`: 39 tests; `test_weather.js`: 37 tests | ✅ **Confirmed** |

### 2.1 Claim Analysis

**Claim #1 (test_sw.js)**: This is the most concerning gap. The agent memory states "11 service worker unit tests covering install/activate/fetch lifecycle, cache strategy, same-origin vs cross-origin caching" were delivered. No version of this file exists in any git commit. Either:
- The tester agent's memory was aspirational (planned but not implemented)
- The file was lost in a rebase conflict (possible given the high commit velocity)
- The claim was fabricated

**Recommendation**: If SW tests are desired, they need to be authored. SW testing in Node.js requires mock `Cache`, `FetchEvent`, `Request`, `Response` APIs — non-trivial to set up.

**Claim #7 (ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md)**: The issue #5 comment says "commit to follow" but the file never arrived. Only `tech_lead/README.md` exists.

## 3. Gap Analysis: What's Still Broken Since Phase 1

| Issue | First Flagged | Age | Impact |
|-------|--------------|-----|--------|
| SW cache catch bug | Phase 2 (this run) | Hours | Minor — wrong fallback on network+fresh cache failure |
| weather.py: no `uv_index_max` | Phase 1 | ~30 commits | Daily forecast missing UV max data |
| weather.py: no hourly | Phase 1 | ~30 commits | CLI can't show hourly forecast unlike web app |
| WMO code drift risk | Phase 2 | Hours | Silent display bug if new codes added |
| No render/DOM tests | Phase 2 | Hours | 130+ lines of rendering logic untested |
| Placeholder contrast fails WCAG AA | Phase 2 | Hours | Accessibility violation for low-vision users |

---

## 4. Index.html Growth Analysis

| Metric | Run 6 (Phase 1) | Run 7 (Phase 2) | Delta |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Total lines | 1673 | 2064 | **+391** |
| CSS blocks | 1 | 1 | Same |
| JS functions | ~15 | **26** | +11 new functions |
| New features | — | alerts, hourly render, forecast toggle, refresh bar, SW update banner | 5 new features |

**Net new code**: ~391 lines added, primarily JS for new features. The CSS may have been slightly reduced (weather backgrounds refactored?), but the monolithic structure persists.

---

## 5. Cross-Agent Consistency Check

### 5.1 WMO Code Set Size

| Location | Code Count | Source |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| `index.html` `wmoCodes` | 28 | Direct count |
| `index.html` `wmoDescriptions` | 28 | Direct count |
| `weather.py` `WMO_ICONS` | 28 | Direct count |
| `weather.py` `WMO_DESC` | 28 | Direct count |
| `tests/test_weather.js` | 28 | Line 218 assertion |

**All agree on 28 codes**. The values are consistent across all 5 locations. WMO drift has not occurred yet — the risk is future additions.

### 5.2 API Parameter Consistency

| Parameter | index.html | weather.py | Match? |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| `current` fields | 10 fields | 10 fields | ✅ Same set |
| `daily` fields | 7 fields (includes `uv_index_max`) | 6 fields (missing `uv_index_max`) | ❌ **Mismatch** |
| `hourly` fields | 3 fields (`temperature_2m,weather_code,precipitation_probability`) | None | ❌ **Missing from CLI** |

The `daily` parameter set diverged at some point — `index.html` added `uv_index_max` but `weather.py` was not updated to match.

---

## 6. SW Update Notification Flow

A new feature added since Phase 2: SW update banner + offline indicator.

```
SW install → controllerchange → window.location.reload()
    ↕
SW update detected → showUpdateBanner() → user clicks "Обновить"
    → reg.waiting.postMessage({type:'SKIP_WAITING'})
    → activate → clients.claim() → controllerchange fires
```

This is a **correct implementation** of the standard SW update flow. No bugs identified.

### 6.1 Offline Detection

```javascript
window.addEventListener('online', updateStatusBar);
window.addEventListener('offline', updateStatusBar);
```

`updateStatusBar()` (line 1660) toggles a status banner. Simple, correct.

## 7. Phase 2 Recommendation Status

| # | Recommendation | Status | Evidence |
|---|---------------|--------|----------|
| P0-1 | Fix SW cache catch bug | ❌ **Open** | `sw.js:57-58` unchanged |
| P0-2 | Add PNG icons to manifest | ❌ **Open** | `manifest.json` unchanged |
| P0-3 | Add test runners to CI | ✅ **Fixed** | `ci.yml` lines 47-55 |
| P1-4 | Extract WMO codes to shared JSON | ❌ **Open** | Still in 5 locations |
| P1-5 | Fix placeholder contrast | ❌ **Open** | CSS unchanged |
| P1-6 | Add CSP meta tag | ❌ **Open** | No `<meta http-equiv>` CSP |
| P1-7 | Remove `.highlighted` dead code | ❌ **Open** | CSS still defines `.highlighted` |

**Resolution rate**: 1/7 (14%). Only the CI test runner recommendation was addressed.

## 8. Risk Summary

| Risk | Severity | Trend |
|------|----------|-------|
| Monolithic index.html (2064 lines) | 🔴 High | ↑ Growing |
| No render/DOM tests | 🔴 High | → Same |
| SW cache catch bug | 🟡 Medium | → Same |
| weather.py missing features | 🟡 Medium | → Same |
| WMO code drift | 🟡 Medium | → Risk only (not occurred) |
| No CSP headers | 🟢 Low | → Same |
| Placeholder contrast fail | 🟢 Low | → Same |

---

## 9. Conclusion

The codebase has grown functionally (alerts, hourly forecast, SW update, offline indicator) but not structurally. The monolithic `index.html` is now 2064 lines. 1 of 7 Phase 2 recommendations was implemented. The `test_sw.js` claim in agent memory is false — it never existed in git history. SW bug and weather.py gaps remain unfixed.

**The project is feature-rich but accumulating technical debt faster than it's being resolved.** The CI pipeline is the only structural improvement that landed.
